Howdy!

Welcome to Nokia. This is the readme for my training repository for git.
Things you need to know about Nokia:
	Started as a paper company in the 1800s
	Phones are no longer our priority
	Primarily, we provide networking solutions
Please ask questions whenever you find you don't understand something. We are largely VERY friendly!

P.S. This is a change made during training.
