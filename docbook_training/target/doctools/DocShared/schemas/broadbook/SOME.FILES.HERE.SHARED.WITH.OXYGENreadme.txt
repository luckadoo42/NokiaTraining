
Some files in this folder are shared with the Oxygen updater.

See JCBG-1648 for details, or examine the latest pom.xml for the oxygen updater project, in pubs\oxygen\updater

That pom.xml has code that copies files out of THIS folder and inserts them into a folder in the oxygen framework, so that we can have RNG files that we edit in ONE location.
