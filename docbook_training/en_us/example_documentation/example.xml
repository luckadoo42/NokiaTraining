            <para>This is an example section. As you will see, this is a very important part of using DocBook. You can even have sub-sections!</para>

		    <title>Example sub-section</title>
			    <para>See! There's really no limit to the number of sub-sections you can have. I mean, I'm sure there is an actual limit, but unless you are trying to find it, you shouldn't ever really run into that issue. Maybe that could be a fun experiment for someone with scripting experience! "How many subsections can DocBook handle?" I'd guess there's a practical limit and an actual limit; practical limit would be where the sub-sectioning stops getting formatted well, and the actual limit would cause a build to break. This is just a guess!</para>

	  <title>Example Chapter</title>
	  <para>This is an example chapter. You actually don't even need to have a section to create text in a chapter, but you most often will want to use a section anyway. Still, this is to show that you <b>can</b> do text sans section.</para>
