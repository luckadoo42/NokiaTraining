<p>This is a physical device (UE) and could be a phone, SIM, water/gas/electricity meter, car, or a computer.  Subscriptions can be attached to a device and it is possible for each device to have unlimited (or at least 100) subscriptions associated to it, which can be used for the various usage types. A device can exist in the database or be created as part of a subscribers profile. The device record contains an indicator of its type (for example, an Apple Iphone or Samsung Galaxy S6), which is mapped to a TAC database, stored either internally or externally. The device record contains the IMEI where appropriate for that type of device or some other device indicator. </p>
<p>The Provisioning module will also append the pre-filled values along with the changed values
                while sending the Update request to the NCC.</p>
