<section><title>What is a trigger</title>
<p>A trigger is an event that occurs on a system and starts an evaluation, like session establishment. Rule groups are combined within a given trigger to increase execution speed for the rules that are relevant to the specific event. Each session type has its own trigger allowing for customization based on specific session type attributes. Some triggers like QoS Management run at multiple events and can use and modify attributes that are common between the events. This reduces the duplication of rules for each event type. </p>
<p>The rules are organized by trigger and are used to separate the rule base. The triggers improve processing speed and efficiency by grouping common sets of decisions to facilitate configuration. Triggers determine when the associated rule groups are analyzed and provide filtering for the options available when you configure rules. That is, specific rule criteria and action options appear and can be selected for each trigger type.</p>
