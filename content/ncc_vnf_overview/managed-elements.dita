<section><title>Overview</title>
<p>A Managed Element (ME) is a network element provisioned from the topology data in SDC (ETCD).  The managed element list is populated from the topology data in the auxiliary node (SDC/ETCD).  Each site has access to the entire data set, so SM knows all the MEs, all their capabilities, and all the connectivity. The charging node is an ME used for online charging functions. The policy node is an ME used for the policy functions.</p>
<p>SM interacts with MEs using the SOAP services. When an ME is registered with SM, the ME details are saved in the SM local database. </p>
<p>A registered ME has either of the following states:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>ONLINE</b>: The ME state is considered online when ME responds to the network communication over the provisioning interface. This is determined using the heartbeat mechanism that SM uses to check the status of each registered ME.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>OFFLINE</b>: The ME state is considered offline when ME does not respond to the network communication over the provisioning interface.</p>
</li>
</ul>
