<title>5G architecture and interfaces</title>
<conbody>
<p>This chapter describes the architecture and interfaces in a 5G network. All the VNFâ€™s in
            the 5G system expose services that each other can use to perform activities, and those
            services can orchestrate differently between different network slices. </p>
