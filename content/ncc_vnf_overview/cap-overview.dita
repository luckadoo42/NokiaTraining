<section><title>Overview</title>
<p>A Cap is the limit applied by the top-level group to the device on its hierarchy resources either directly (directly applied to the device) or indirectly (applied to the low-level group and hence to the devices associated with that low-level group). </p>
<p>Operators can define the Caps using the <uicontrol>Cap</uicontrol> option from the <uicontrol>Common</uicontrol> tab on the SM GUI.</p>
