<section><title>Overview</title>
<p>Diameter message throttling can be used to limit the rate at which Diameter requests flow through the system. Throttling is implemented as a plugin-based feature which appears twice in the plugin sequence. The ingress plugin is in the request plugin sequence, and the egress plugin and is deployed at the end of the request plugin sequence.</p>
<p>See the "NCC Diameter User Guide" for more information.</p>
<p>The throttling plugin uses message filters to define scenarios for which message rates need to be limited and the actions to take to when the message rated exceeds a threshold. Throttling profiles are used to encapsulate throttling configuration. There are four types of throttling profiles defined for the feature. Depending on the profile type, it can be invoked by either the ingress throttling plugin or egress throttling plugin.</p>
