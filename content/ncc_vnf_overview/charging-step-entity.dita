<section><title>Overview</title>
<p>The charging step entity allows you to configure bucket amount from bundles in steps. The reference of charging step must be present in the bucket definition. For example, consider that you define 5 steps, Step 1 -&gt; 1 GB, Step 2 -&gt; 1 GB, Step 3 -&gt; 1 GB, Step 4 -&gt; 2 GB, Step 5 -&gt; 15 GB. Initially, only 1 GB is available to the user. Once this 1 GB of bundle is exhausted, the next available resource is checked, that is, other bundles. If there is no amount available, then step-up is used and the step bucket is moved to Step 2 and has 1 GB available for usage. This process continues until all the data available is exhausted. Note that the SM bundle is moved to Step 2 only when the call does not consume any bytes in between from another bucket. The steps are maintained in a list and used to change the initial value of the step charge bucket instance. The Charging step must have at least one step. The same charging step can be referenced from multiple buckets. Addition, deletion,
modification of steps is allowed, but you cannot reduce the step from 1 to 0.</p>
