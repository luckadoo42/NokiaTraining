        <title>Publishing and reverting lookup configuration</title>
        <body>
            <p>Lookup tables are used for managing the configuration of distribution rules through
                Data Refinery UI. After modifications, lookup tables must be published to the
                database for the configuration changes to take effect.</p>
            <p>The lookup configuration currently in use (published) can be seen as read-only lookup
                tables with suffix P_ in the table names. The corresponding editable draft lookup
                tables have the same name but without the prefix. If necessary, it is also possible
                to revert a draft lookup table back to its previous published state.</p>
