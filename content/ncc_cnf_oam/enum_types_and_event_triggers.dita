                                    <p>The Bearer-Control-Mode AVP type is Enumerated and is sent
                                        from the PCRF to the PCEF or BBERF; indicates the
                                        PCRF-selected bearer control mode.</p>
                                    <p>When Network-Request_ Supported AVP is absent from the CCR-I,
                                        the NCC default behavior is to set Bearer-Control-Mode to
                                        “UE_only” in CCA-I.</p>
                                    <p>CAUTION: When importing a rules system version saved from a
                                        previous release of the NCC, do not use the
                                        Bearer-Control-Mode action UE_NW in the NCC operator policy
                                        rule engine to override a UE_only downlink network (access
                                        network and SGSN.) If this takes place, this action would
                                        most likely to be rejected.</p>
                                    <p>When importing such a rule system version, change the
                                        Bearer-Control-Mode value from UE_NW to "Not Set".</p>
                                    <p>Note: If a gateway expects no Bearer-Control-Mode in CCA-I
                                        when Network-RequestSupported AVP is absent from the CCR-I,
                                        an operator policy rule should be created in the IP-CAN
                                        session or gateway control session establishment rule set
                                        (and session modification rule set, if required), with a
                                        condition "if NRS not present", and action
                                        "BCM=Remove-BCM".</p>

                                        physical part of CDMA mobile station equipment. The number
                                        format is defined by the 3GPP2 report S.R0048.</p>

                                    <p>There are a number of types of terminals that have

                                        identifiers can be converted to modified EUI-64 format, as
                                        described in [IPv6Addr], or by using another method that is

                </table><note>The NCC has predefined default event triggers in the rule set that are
                    defined by 3GPP TS 29.212; however, the default event triggers may be
                    overwritten by defining custom event triggers to meet custom requirements. The
                    Event Triggers marked with an asterisk (*) are dynamically added because they
                    are added based on the IP-CAN type, interface type, and device type.</note></p>
