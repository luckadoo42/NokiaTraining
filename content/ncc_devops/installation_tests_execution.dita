<p>In Airflow NCC installation is done using workflows defined in the workflow configuration
            package. Test suites execution on the other hand can be done in two ways in Airflow. One
            way is using workflows in the workflow configuration package. The other way is using
            variables defined in the Airflow GUI. This chapter describes how to perform installation
            and run test suites in Airflow.</p>
