   <title>Using Kerberose</title>
   <conbody>

      <p>Kerberos works with hostnames. The NCCNS Kafka client needs to resolve the hostname of the
         kerberos server/kdc. </p>
      <p>The IP to hostname mapping(s) of the Kerberos server must be added to the
            <filepath>/etc/hosts</filepath> of the SPSNS container. This can be done by the
         following:</p>
      <p/>
      <ol>

         <li>
            <p>Add the following keys to SDC from the OAME (or any other) node. One key each for each hostname that needs to be resolved to an IP.</p>
            <p>
               <b>Note:</b> It is recommended to contact Nokia support to add keys to the SDC.</p>
            <p>examples:</p>
            <p>config/spsns/hosts/&lt;hostname> &lt;IPv4></p>
            <p>config/spsns/hosts/kerberos1.com 1.1.1.1</p>
            <p>config/spsns/hosts/kerberos2.com 1.1.1.2</p>
            <p>config/spsns/hosts/server1 1.1.1.3</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>The entry of the added hosts will be added to <i>/etc/hosts</i> of the NCCNS
               container on TPA restart (using <userinput>TPA_control stop</userinput> and
                  <userinput>TPA_control start</userinput>) of the comsvc node(s)</p>
            <p>
               <b>Note:</b> The addition of external hosts to the hosts file of SPSNS containers is
               done only for the NCC BVNF solution. For NCC BCMT solution, the entry for external
               hosts must be added manually to all the NS containers.</p>
         </li>
      </ol>
