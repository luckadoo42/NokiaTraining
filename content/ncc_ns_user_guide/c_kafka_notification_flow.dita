   <title>Kafka notification flow</title>
   <conbody>

      <p>NS first tries to send the notification to the primary Kafka broker. If NS is unable to send the notification to the primary Kafka broker, even after configured number of retries, NS raises an alarm and then sends notification to secondary Kafka broker. If NS is unable to send the notification to the secondary Kafka broker as well, then it raises an alarm and notification failure information is logged. EDR is generated both for success and failure cases.</p>
