<section><title>Overview</title>
<p>Sessions in NCC application are either terminated with a CCR-T request or cleaned by a session
                audit logic, if the session is found as stale one.</p>
<p>A CCR-T is processed whether a wrong MSCC or no MSCC value is received. However, if MSCC has an entry in the Diameter Gy session but the MSCC value is not received for a CCR-T, then an alarm is raised.</p>
<note>The <i>RSU</i> AVP value is ignored in a CCR-T request.<p/></note>
