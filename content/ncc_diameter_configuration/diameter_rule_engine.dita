<section><title>Diameter Rule engine application plugin overview</title>
<p>The Diameter Rule Engine application plugin is supported to enable the handling of generic
                message manipulation scenarios. It implements an event-driven, forward-chaining rule
                evaluation algorithm to facilitate the NCCâ€™s routing functions: relaying, modifying,
                and Diameter message answering. </p>
<p>After the Diameter Rules Engine plugin has been sequenced, the application plugin is evaluated and invoked by the system to process Diameter messages as shown in the following figure.</p>

<section><title>Rule profile (Diameter rule system version)</title>
<p>A rule system version captures a series of triggers and associated rule groups. The SM supports a graphical drag-and-drop interface with an embedded text editor for creating rules.</p>
