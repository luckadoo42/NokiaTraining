<p>This parameter defines how the CDR application is audited; whether or not and how the file is deleted from the CDR VM. </p>
<p>This parameter is defined as follows:</p>
<codeblock>{"enabled":"yes","age":7,"time_started":"0000"}</codeblock>

<li>
<p>&lt;age&gt; is the age of the CDR files in days. The value range is [1,180].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&lt;time_started&gt; is the time when the audit shall start. The format of this value is hhmm, for example, 2359, which is one minute to midnight.</p>

<row>
<entry>cdr/producer/kafka_producer/acks </entry>
<entry>
<p>This parameter defines the number of acknowledgments that the producer requires the leader to receive before considering the request completed. This controls the durability of records that are sent.</p>
<p> The supported values are <i>all</i>, 0 (zero) and 1.</p><ul>

<li>
<p>If the value is 0 (zero), then the producer does not wait for any acknowledgment from the server at all. The record is immediately added to the socket buffer and considered sent. In this case, no guarantee can be made that the server has received the record, and the retries configuration does not take effect since Client generally is not aware of any failures. The offset given back for each record is always set to -1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the value is 1, the leader writes the record to its local log but responds without waiting for the full acknowledgement from all the followers. In this case, if the leader fails immediately after acknowledging the record but before the followers have replicated this record, then this record is lost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the value is <i>all</i>, the leader waits for the full set of in-sync replicas to acknowledge the record. This guarantees that the record will not be lost as long as at least one in-sync replica remains alive. This is the strongest available guarantee.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry>cdr/producer/kafka_producer/batch.size </entry>
<entry>
<p>This parameter defines the default batch size in bytes.</p>
<p>The producer attempts to batch records together into fewer requests whenever multiple records are sent to the same partition. This improves performance on the client and on the server. </p>
<p>No attempt will be made to batch records larger than this size.</p>
<p>The requests sent to brokers contain multiple batches, one for each partition with data available to be sent.</p>
<p>A small batch size makes batching less common and may reduce throughput. (The zero batch size disables batching entirely.) A very large batch size may use memory a bit more wastefully as we always allocate a buffer of the specified batch size in anticipation of additional records.</p>
</entry>
<entry>
N/A
</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry>cdr/producer/kafka_producer/bootstrap.servers </entry>
<entry>
This parameter is a list of host/port pairs for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. The client uses all the servers irrespective of which servers are specified for bootstrapping. This list only impacts the initial hosts used to discover the full set of servers.
</entry>
<entry>
N/A
</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry>cdr/producer/kafka_producer/buffer.memory </entry>
<entry>
<p>This parameter defines the total number of memory bytes that the producer can use to buffer records waiting to be sent to the server. </p>
<p>If the records are sent faster than they can be delivered to the server, the producer blocks for &lt;max.block.ms&gt; after which it throws an exception. </p>
<p>This setting should correspond roughly to the total memory that the producer is going to use, but this is not a hard bound since not all this memory is used for buffering. Some additional memory is used for compression, if compression is enabled, as well as for maintaining in-flight requests.</p>
<p>The value range is 0...</p>
</entry>
<entry>
N/A
</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry>cdr/producer/kafka_producer/linger.ms </entry>
<entry>
<p>This parameter adds a small amount of artificial delay. Rather than sending out a record immediately, the producer waits for up to the specified delay to allow other records to be sent so that these records can be batched together.</p>
<p>The value range is 0...</p>
</entry>
<entry>
N/A
</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry>cdr/producer/kafka_producer/max.block.ms </entry>
<entry>
<p>This parameter controls for how long CDR sending is blocked either because the buffer is full or metadata is unavailable. Blocking the user-supplied serializers or partitioner is not counted against this timeout.</p>
<p>The value range is 0...</p>

<entry>
N/A

<entry>cdr/producer/kafka_producer_mgr/sendpool.size </entry>

N/A
</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry>cdr/producer/kafka_producer/request.timeout.ms </entry>
<entry>
<p>This parameter defines the maximum amount of time that the client waits for the response of a request. If the response is not received before the timeout elapses, the client resends the request if necessary or fails the request if retries are exhausted.</p>
<p>The value range is 0...</p>
</entry>
<entry>
N/A
</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry>cdr/producer/kafka_producer/retries </entry>
<entry>
<p>Setting a value greater than zero causes the client to resend any record whose send fails with a potentially transient error.</p>
<p>This is similar to when the client resends the record upon receiving an error. </p>
<p>Allowing retries without setting &lt;max.in.flight.requests.per.connection&gt; to 1 potentially changes the ordering of records because if two batches are sent to a single partition and the first one fails and after failure it is resent, but the second batch succeeds, then the records from the second batch may appear first.</p>
<p>The value range is [0,2147483647].</p>

<p>This parameter reports the offset of a produced message back to the application. The application must use theÂ dr_msg_cbÂ to retrieve the offset fromÂ rd_kafka_message_t.offset.Â </p>

<p>This parameter indicates how many acknowledgements the leader broker must receive from ISR brokers before responding to the request.</p><ul>

<li>
<p>If the value is Â 0 (zero), the leader broker does not send any response/ack to the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Â the value is 1, only the leader broker needs to acknowledge the message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the value is Â -1Â orÂ <i>all</i>, the leader broker blocks until the message is committed by all in sync replicas (ISRs) or brokerâsÂ &lt;in.sync.replicassetting&gt; before sending a response.</p>

<b>CDR index parameters</b>
</p>
<p>CDR index parameters contain &lt;group index&gt; portion, which is a number in the range of
                                [0,200]. However, the usage of the value zero (â0â) is restricted by
                                the NCC platform, thus the value zero cannot be used.</p>
<p>The group index is used to bifurcate data based on the following:</p><ul>

<li>
<p>CDR or EDR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>record type</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MVNO implementation</p>

<entry>cdr/&lt;group index&gt;/dest_dir </entry>
<entry>
<p>This parameter defines the path where the CDR file that corresponds to the group index is written. </p>
<p>Ensure that there is sufficient disk space for cdr_record_volume where the CDR/EDR files are
                                stored. All VM sizing is done prior to instantiation and there is no
                                re-sizing. Prior to instantiation, see the NCC Dimensioning and
