<p>This chapter introduces the subscriber model and how the subscriber management happens in the
            Nokia Converged Charging (NCC) database. The Subscriber model is responsible for storing
            the NCC subscriber data and includes geo-redundant storage, such as types of subscriber
            information, validation of subscriber information being stored, and notification of any
            changes to the existing subscriber information. The Subscriber model can provision
            users, accounts, groups, and devices with defined relationships for their mutual
            interactions.</p>
