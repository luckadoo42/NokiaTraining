<p>This chapter describes how NCC monitors numerous parameters of the network, and the health and
            integrity of servers. It also describes how to monitor the system using NCC heartbeat,
            which allows NCC systems to communicate status about their own connectivity and state,
            as well as their view of the other known NCC systems. In addition, it describes how to
