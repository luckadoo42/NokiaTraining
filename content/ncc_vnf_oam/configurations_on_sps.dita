<p>This chapter describes how to configure NCC for integration with NetAct post instantiation of
            NCC. NCC alarms and performance measurements can be integrated with NetAct using SNMP
            and SFTP connections. This chapter also provides instruction to change the IANA number
            for NetAct support.</p>
<p>The performance measurements configuration described in this chapter must be applied to all the
            NCC ME and SM sites.</p>
