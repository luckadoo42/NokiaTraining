                                <p>CAUTION: When importing a rules system version saved from a

                                    action UE_NW in the NCC operator policy rule engine to override
                                    a UE_only downlink network (access network and SGSN.) If you do,
                                    this action would most likely to be rejected.</p>

<note>The NCC has predefined default event triggers in the rule set that are defined by 3GPP TS
                29.212; however, you can overwrite the default event triggers by defining your own
                event triggers to meet your requirements.<p>  The Event Triggers marked with an
                    asterisk (*) are dynamically added because they are added based on the IP-CAN
                    type, interface type, and device type.</p></note>
