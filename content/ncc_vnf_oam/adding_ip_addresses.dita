<sectiondiv>
<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>This procedure provides instructions on how to update the Scalable file with sufficient number of external network IP addresses needed to scale-out a VNF. When you scale-out a VNF and the number of existing external IP addresses is not enough, the VNFâ€™s Scalable file has to be updated with extra IP addresses needed for the VMs that are being added. The only way to add IP addresses to the Scalable file is to generate the CSAR package again with a new Scalable file using the VNF Generator Tool. This new Scalable file is called scalable_for_scale.json file.</p>

<note>This procedure applies to the external network only.<p>To update the Scalable file:</p></note></context><steps>
<step><cmd>Contact Nokia Professional Services to obtain the new CSAR package and ensure the following:</cmd><info><ul>
<li>
<p>The external IP address range is extended for a VDU scale-out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new Scalable file is named <filepath>scalable_for_scale.json </filepath> and added to the same output directory in <filepath>cbam_package.zip</filepath> with the original Scalable file.</p>
</li>
</ul></info></step>
<step><cmd>Log in to the CBAM GUI and upload <filepath>scalable_for_scale.json </filepath> file to CBAM using the procedure <i>Changing CSAR package version</i> in <i>Installation and Upgrade Guide</i>.</cmd><info/></step>
