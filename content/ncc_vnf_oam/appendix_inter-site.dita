<p>This appendix describes how an external Diameter entity sends traffic to a specific NCC site and
            that NCC site handles routing that request internally between the NCC sites in a single
            region. </p>
<p>For an unknown subscriber Gx attach, the NCC-ME will proactively send the device create request
            to SM for device creation at the SM.</p>
