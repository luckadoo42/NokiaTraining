<p>NCC supports per-request and per-session CDR generation. In case of per-session CDR, the CDR is
                not generated until there is an active session. The CDR is generated only when a
                trigger to generate a CDR is received. The trigger can be a terminate request or
                audit.</p>
<p>Single CDR can be configured in IMS, SMS, and MMS calls using rules. If this is configured, then a single CDR is generated for MOC, MTC, and FWD calls at the time of call termination or at audit.</p>
