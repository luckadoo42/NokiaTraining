            <p>Whenever a session/event request has occurred, it is either successful or
                unsuccessful depending upon the logic processing in NCC. The
                    <i>RecordEventResult</i> tag contains the numeric number created by NCC
                explaining the cause of session/event closure.</p>
            <p>Example: <i>recordEventResult</i> = <varname>21</varname>
            </p>
            <p>Following are the record event result ranges with their descriptions:</p>
