    <title>Purpose</title>
    <conbody>
      <p>If NCC is configured with an LDAP external subscriber profile repository, and there is no
        Device, the records are retrieved from the external LDAP server based on the subscriber IDs.
        NCC generates EDRs for all such LDAP search events.</p>
