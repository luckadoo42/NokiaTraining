<p>The service model in NCC comprises of top-level service entities that directly represent and
            define the service assigned and delivered to the subscribers, and configuration
            assisting in the simplification and usability of service definitions. The charging
            service, usage control service, and Internet of Things (IoT) policy service types are
            defined for NCC. These services define the interaction between the network and
            subscriber, and the way in which NCC delivers, collects, and rates the consumption of
            resources by subscribers.</p>
<p>This chapter describes all service model entities, which mostly includes the charging entities defined under the <uicontrol>Policy &amp; Charging Configuration</uicontrol> &gt; <uicontrol>CHARGING</uicontrol> tab in the Service Manager Graphical User Interface (SM GUI).</p>
