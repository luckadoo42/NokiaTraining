<section><title>Overview</title>
<p>This feature explains handling the <i>Tariff-Time-Change</i> (TTC), which is the switch time when a tariff is changed for a data session. After a tariff switch is reached, all active user sessions report their session usage by the end of validity period of the current request or receive new quota for resource usage for the new tariff period.</p>
<p>In order to avoid the need for multiple simultaneous quota refresh trials, the traffic usage is split into resource usage before a tariff switch and resources used after a tariff switch, which means a bundle, bucket, or counter may be changed during this switch time.</p>
<p>During a data call, if the TTC time calculated is nearing, then the quota allocation is handled
                accordingly. The portion of the call before and after the TTC time may have
                different tariff rates. When a CCR received includes two or three USU instances in
                one MSCC, the NCC call controller handles the reported usage separately in the USU
                instances due to the session that ranges crossing TTC times. NCC handles USU before
                tariff changes and after tariff change in sequence.</p>
</section>
<section><title>TTC handling - before and after BCR time</title>
<p>NCC considers the following points while handling the tariff change:</p><ul>
<li><p>There is no limitation on the number of USUs. If multiple USUs are received with same
                            <i>Tariff-Change-Usage</i> (TCU) value, then the service accumulates the
                        value of same types of USU. The ME application parameter <uicontrol>Gy TCU
                            Indeterminate</uicontrol> identifies whether the first USU value with
                            <i>Tariff-Change-Usage</i> (<varname>2 -INDETERMINATE</varname>) is
                        added before the tariff change usage, after the tariff change usage, or is
                        completely ignored.</p>
                    <!--MMO resource relative URI: ../Graphics/Release_18.9/TTC_ME_Parameter_default.png-->
                    <image href="../images/img9yz-09126-ug01-pczza-sp1-ttc_me_parameter_default.png"
                        scale="50"/>
                </li>
<li>
<p>If the reported USU <i>Before Tariff Change</i> (BTC) is greater than zero but less than GSU, then the usage is committed before tariff change to pre-BCR version of subscription (from which reservation was done). In case of carry-over bucket, the initial or unused value in carry-over bucket instance gets updated when the usage is committed before tariff change. If the reported USU before tariff change is greater than GSU, then GSU is committed on pre-BCR version of subscription, and the over committed part (USU before tariff change â€“ GSU) is added to the usage after tariff change. Notification is sent when configured in the rule engine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The subscriptions are sorted again at the start of CCR message since after the tariff switch time, and if BCR or subscription activation occurred, then some subscriptions may be switched from valid to invalid and vice-versa. After the subscriptions or charging services are sorted based on predefined priorities, the application condition is checked for each Charging Service (CS) with slice allocation time set to tariff switch time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the reported USU After Tariff Change (ATC) is greater than zero, then the usage is committed based on the newly sorted subscriptions or CS list. The USU ATC is handled as overcommit since the charging services are re-selected.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A notification is sent after committing the ATC or BTC usage. To support multiple USU
                        instances in the CCR message, the rule trigger <i>RATING_POST_PROCESSING</i>
                        is changed as shown in the following figure and the notification variable
                        USU is obtained from the <i>RATING_POST_PROCESSING</i> source context.</p>

<section><title>Entity lifecycle - validity time of current state</title>
<p>Every entity has an entity lifecycle associated to it with defined states and transitions. The state of the resource may have a validity time linked to it. If the state validity time is defined, then transition takes place at the same configured time. The TTC logic considers the minimum of BCR and the validity time of the current state to determine the TTC to be sent to the gateway.</p>
<p>Assume there are two TTC users with the following behavior:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>If the BCR value of resource is greater than or equal to the value of entity lifecycle state validity time, then TTC is not configured and VT is set as the state validity time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the BCR value of resource is less than the value of entity lifecycle state validity time, then BCR is configured as TTC.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<note>
<p>Only those subscriptions are considered for state validity time and BCR, from where the reservation is performed.</p>
</note>
<sectiondiv>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p>
<i>Configuration or provisioning:</i>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Consider two subscriptions <varname>Sub1</varname> and <varname>Sub2</varname>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<varname>Sub1</varname> has an entity lifecycle with current state <varname>Active</varname> at <userinput>2018/7/25 09:25:00</userinput> with validity time of 1 hour and <varname>Sub1</varname> has end time <userinput>2018/7/25 11:30:00</userinput>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<varname>Sub2</varname> has an end time or BCR at <userinput>2018/7/25 14:30:00</userinput>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Validity time of 86400 seconds in slicing profile.</p>
<p>A user makes a data call at <userinput>2018/7/25 9:30:00</userinput>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<i>Few observations for TTC and VT:</i>
</p>
<p>During TTC calculation, the end time of <varname>Sub1</varname> is compared with its state entity lifecycle.</p>
<p>
<userinput>2018/7/25 10:25:00</userinput> (validity time of 1 hour) &lt; end time of <varname>Sub1</varname> (<userinput>2018/7/25 11:30:00</userinput>) &lt; end time of <varname>Sub2</varname> (<userinput>2018/7/25 14:30:00</userinput>) &lt; VT (slicing profile)</p>
<p>Therefore, TTC is not configured and VT is set to 55 minutes (<userinput>2018/7/25 10:25:00</userinput> - current call).</p>

<section><title>TTC and TCU AVP support</title>
<p>The <i>Tariff-Time-Change</i> AVP is supported in a CCA message and used within the <i>GSU</i> AVP to determine the tariff switch time. In this feature, global TTC time configured in the RSV, future activation time of subscriptions, or TTC configured in bundle rules or RSV is <uicontrol>Tariff-Time-Change</uicontrol>, which is an optional parameter.</p>
<p>The <i>Tariff-Change-Usage</i> AVP is supported in CCR message and its value type is date. The <i>TCU</i> AVP is used within <i>USU</i> AVP to distinguish reported usage before and after the tariff time change.</p>
<userinput>
&lt;Used-Service-Unit&gt; ::= &lt;AVP Header: 446 &gt;
[Tariff-Change-Usage]</userinput>
<p>The value type of <i>Tariff-Change-Usage</i> AVP is enumerated.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>
<varname>0 - UNIT_BEFORE_TARIFF_CHANGE</varname>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<varname>1 - UNIT_AFTER_TARIFF_CHANGE</varname>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<varname>2 - UNIT_INDETERMINATE</varname>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The ME application preference parameter <uicontrol>Gy TCU Indeterminate</uicontrol> indicates how to process the usage with the <i>Tariff-Charge-Usage</i> AVP. See <!--xref URI: t-Application_preferences.xml#system_pref--><xref keyref="id9YZ-09126-UG01-PCZZA-SP1-system_pref"/> for more details on this parameter.</p>
</section>
<section id="VTandTTC"><title>VT and TTC calculation</title>
<p>When the TTC feature is enabled, the <i>GSU</i> AVP in the CCA message is configured under one of the following conditions:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>If BCR occurs within the VT of the granted quota and NCC application considers the <i>Timezone
                            ID</i> of the account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If future activation time of subscription or <i>Subscription State Validity Time</i> (which is, the entity lifecycle current state time).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>During quota allocation, the end time or <i>Subscription Current State Validity Time</i> of the subscriptions used in quota reservation, which are associated with subscription used for quota reservation is checked and the start time or the future activation time is retrieved from all subscriptions and corresponding groups. The start time, end time, and future activation time are sorted, which are later than the call start time and within the VT to get the nearest time and second nearest time. If the subscription does not attach to any period lifecycle, then the associated account period lifecycle start time or end time is used.</p>
<p>After getting the TTC and VT values, if the values of both <i>TTCAF</i> and <i>VTAF</i> are greater than zero, then the TTC and VT values are adjusted as per the following criteria:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>If the (current time + VT) is between TTC time calculated and TTC time calculated + 2 seconds</p>
<p>
<systemoutput>TTC = TTC calculated date + 1 second</systemoutput>
</p>
<p>
<systemoutput>VT = Time to TTC + 2 seconds</systemoutput>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is a policy counter attached to a device whose status gets changed during TTC date processing, the TTC and VT is calculated as follows:</p>
<p>
<systemoutput>TTC = TTC calculated date + RAND [1 second, TTCAF]</systemoutput>
</p>
<p>
<systemoutput>VT = time to TTC + 1 second</systemoutput>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, if the device does not currently have one or more policy counters whose status change during TTC calculated processing, then the TTC and VT are calculated as follows:</p>
<p>
<systemoutput>TTC = TTC calculated date + RAND [1 second, MIN(TTCAF, VT-time to TTC-1 second)]</systemoutput>
</p>
<p>
<systemoutput>VT = TTC Time calculated date + RAND [2 seconds, MIN(VTs-time to TTC, VTAF)]</systemoutput>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<sectiondiv>
<p><b>Example: TTC and VT adjustment when device has a policy counter that changes during TTC time calculated</b></p>
<p>
<b>Scenario:</b>
</p>
<p>This example shows a case when there is a policy counter TTC Time calculated within VTs and policy counter status is changed during BCR. TTC and VT for the session are set as per the following formulae:</p>
<userinput>TTC = TTC Time calculated + RAND[1 second, TTCAF]</userinput>
<userinput>VT = time to TTC + 1 second</userinput>
<p>
<b>Provisioning:</b> Provision the following entities:</p><ol>

<p><b>GSU additional check</b></p>
<p>When the TTC feature is enabled, after the quota reservation, NCC performs additional check for
                    all the subscriptions used for quota allocation. If the <varname>Max
                        Renewal</varname> time has reached or if the account is
                        <varname>PRE_PAID</varname> and has insufficient balance for subscription
                    renewal, then the service ignores the TTC and sets the VT to the subscription
                    end time. In this case, <varname>MIN-VT</varname> is not used.</p>
</sectiondiv>
</section>
<section><title>Assumptions</title>
<p>Following assumptions apply to the TTC feature:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Only the subscription period lifecycle fee is checked. The account lifecycle is considered when the subscription does not have its own lifecycle or account balance is used for charging calls.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Irrespective of whether a subscription renewal is checked individually, there may be some
                        instances for which the renewable check is passed. However, the subscription
                        is not successfully renewed as shown in the following example:</p>
                    <!--MMO resource relative URI: ../Graphics/Release_18.9/TTC_assumption_example_default.png-->
                    <image
                        href="../images/img9yz-09126-ug01-pczza-sp1-ttc_assumption_example_default.png"
                    />
                </li>
<li>
<p>There may be cases wherein the TTC logic finds that the subscriptions can be renewed, but they
                        may actually be not renewed when the lifecycle logic checks get executed.
                        For example, consider that there are three subscriptions with same end time
                        associated with same account. When the TTC logic checks the subscriptions
                        one-by-one, it finds that the subscription is renewable, that is, account
                        balance (10) &gt; subscription renewal fee (5). But, all the three
                        subscriptions have same end time as per calculation, the account balance
                        (10) &lt; subscription renewal fees (5*3). In such cases, NCC logic does not
                        take any action.</p>
