<p>The NCC application preferences are maintained in a common entity called <i>TPASystem</i>. All
                the application preferences are loaded on NCC application initialization within
                    <i>TPASystem</i>. These application preferences are then loaded with some
                default values present in the <filepath>Constants</filepath> file.</p>

                                <p>During the pending PLC and ELC execution, the tps of an SNR gets
                                    very high, around 2000 tps, which restricts providing enough

                                <p>The reason for the high tps of SNR was that since we send SNR on
                                    group in case of PLC renewal or on reaching threshold.
                                    Therefore, if a group has 10 devices and all of them have Sy
                                    sessions established, then the SNR goes for all 10 devices.</p>
                                <p>This timer takes values in minutes and sends an SNR after a
                                    configurable time interval to delay the SNR traffic for the

                                            The delta value is configured using the TPA system
                                            property <i>GY Delta Interval For VT (seconds)</i> that

                                            triggered (this action takes place in best effort mode,
                                            which means only those lifecycle are executed, which we
                                            can execute in 1000 ms or configured time). After
                                            executing all pending lifecycle, we first close the
                                            transaction and then to execute the call, we open new
                                            transaction. If triggered operation take more then 4980
                                            ms, then all trigger operation is rollback and even call
                                            fails. The advantage of this approach is that if we have
                                            executed all pending lifecycle but got error during call
                                            execution, then in that case, at least lifecycles are
                                            updated successfully even if the call is failed and
                                            related data is rollback.</p>

                                <p>This parameter is used to communicate removed Policy counter
                                    state. If this parameter has some value, for example,
                                        <varname>removed</varname>, and if a Policy counter is
                                    removed from the Device, then an SNR is sent to the PCRF with
                                    that Policy counter with policy state
                                    <varname>removed</varname>. If an acknowledgment is received
                                    from the PCRF, then the Policy counter is removed from the
                                    system. Else, it remains in the Sy session and is sent again in
                                    subsequent SNR(s) sent by Charging for any Policy counter.</p>
