    <title>Including usage from previous billing cycle in BCR EDRs</title>
    <conbody>
        <p>To derive monthly billing from billing cycle reset (BCR) EDRs appropriately, all quota
            allocated from the previous billing cycle (for active voice and data sessions when the
            BCR occurs) must be factored in when the BCR EDR is generated. This quota applies to
            account BCR and bundle renewals/expirations. This also includes quota for an account BCR
            date, as well as the quota for subscriptions in which the renewal/expiration date is
            controlled by their own period lifecycle (that is, if subscriptions not linked to the
            account BCR date). This is termed as <i>standalone subscription event</i>, that is, the
            renewal or expiration date for subscriptions is controlled by the subscriptionâ€™s period
            lifecycle.</p>
