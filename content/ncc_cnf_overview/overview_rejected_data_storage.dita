                <p>CG Mapper Node can reject records if there is a problem in processing them. This
                    is a rare case, likely to be caused by new type of data introduced in the
                    incoming records. If CG Mapper Node rejects records, it raises a warning,
                    indicating how many records have been rejected.</p>
