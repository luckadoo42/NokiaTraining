<p>This chapter describes the entities related to the subscriber model.</p>
<p>Subscribers and subscriber data are provisioned, accessed, and stored in either the SPS database or an external SPR (a repository external to the SPS deployment, which may be one of a standards based or non-standards based SPR or UDR). Whether an internal or external SPR is used, the application can interface with and fetch all of the subscriber data (including custom data attributes) needed to process information for SPS-Policy and SPS charging as provisioned.</p>
