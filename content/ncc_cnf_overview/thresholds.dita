<p>A threshold is a definition of a usage counter, or bucket boundary, or limit, and an associated set of actions to take upon crossing that boundary or limit. A threshold profile group contains at least one-threshold profile. A threshold profile contains at least one threshold. The threshold information is defined in a single Threshold Profile Group table. The threshold is embedded within the threshold profile which in turn is embedded within the threshold profile group.</p>
