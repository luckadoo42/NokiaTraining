<section><title>Overview</title>

<p>A counter accumulates the value of defined usage type that can be used against the defined threshold value. A specific action is taken on the basis of the accumulated usage type value, such as sending notification to subscribers. Counters track the consumption of charging services and bucket types associated with the specific charging services.</p>
<p>Operators can configure the SPS to use counters using the <uicontrol>Counters</uicontrol> option from the <uicontrol>Common</uicontrol> tab on the SM GUI.</p>
