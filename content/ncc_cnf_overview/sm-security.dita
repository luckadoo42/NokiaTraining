<section><title>Overview</title>

<p>The SM GUI URL is accessible through HTTP or HTTPS. If a user accesses SM GUI using HTTP, then a redirect is done to HTTPS. From next time onwards, the GUI access is allowed using HTTPS only. </p>
<p>SM accesses the managed elements through SOAP over HTTPS. The SOAP services use the following common security constraints:</p><ul>

<li>
<p>Limited to HTTPS only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bi-directional certificate exchange, that is, the server SPS expects the client SM to send an appropriate certificate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
