<section><title>Overview</title>

<p>The taxation profile entity includes multiple percentage tax rates and applicability condition. Note that the tax is applicable only to the monetary bucket. Rate is mandatory for the taxation to be applied on the monetary resources. If the taxation reference is not provided in the charging service tariff rule, then the taxation does not apply. Fetching the taxation information from bundle or account is not available in this case.</p>
<p>It is recommended not to change the tax/rate in between calls when the session is ongoing. The taxation can be attached to a bundle, account, and lifecycle to implement tax. Taxation is not applicable to the refund cases. The CDR tags generated for the taxation are on committed and reserved values.</p>
