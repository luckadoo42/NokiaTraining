<section><title>Overview</title>

<p>The lifecycle model provides a way to define and manage the behavior of entities within the Service and Subscriber models of the SPS. That is, you can control the behavior of entities in a coherent and entity specific way, track any changes or updates occurring in the system, as well as track how these changes are reflected in the experience of an end user. Lifecycle management takes the complete succession of changes undergone by particular accounts, devices, users, groups or subscriptions and processes the behaviors for these entities to allow correct rating, charging, and processing of all types of usage.</p>
<p>Operators can define the lifecycles used on the SPS using the <uicontrol>Lifecycles</uicontrol> option from the Common tab on the SM GUI.</p>
