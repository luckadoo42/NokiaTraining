<title>Configuration stream</title>
<body>
                
                <p>Some configuration options are defined within the Configuration stream or in Data
                    Refinery lookup tables. These configuration options are published to the
                    database by running the Configuration Stream and thereby taken into use in all
                    the other streams.</p>
                <p>The configuration stored in the lookup tables can be maintained through the Data
                    Refinery UI. Every configuration has a lookup table for the configuration draft
                    and a corresponding read-only lookup table for the latest published
                    configuration, currently in use. The name of the published table has prefix
                    P_.</p>
                <p>Configuration stream consists of two instances of a standalone node, CG
                    Configuration Node â€“ one for publishing configurations and one for reverting
                    configurations. After modifications to draft lookup tables, the node for
                    publishing configurations must be run to take the configuration changes into
                    use. Running the node will attempt to publish all the changed lookup
                    configurations, but before publishing, all the configurations are validated. The
                    publishing proceeds only if all of the configurations are valid. Possible
                    validation errors raise warnings, and the previously configured rules remain in
                    use until CG Configuration Node has been run successfully in publish mode. It is
                    not possible to publish only selected lookup tables. An info message is shown
                    once the node has successfully updated the configuration, unless no changes were
                    needed and therefore no message is shown.</p>
                <p>The other node in the Configuration stream can be used for reverting the draft
                    lookup tables back to the current published state. Any changes done in the draft
                    lookup tables are discarded.</p>
                <p>CG Configuration Node is a schedulable node, which can be run manually or be
                    scheduled to run at a certain time. It is recommended to only run the node
                    manually when needed. The default configurations will be published to the
                    database automatically when the stream is started for the first time, if no
                    configurations exist in the database yet.</p>
                <p>The Configuration stream must always be run once before taking a new version of
                    CDR Streams into use.</p>
