<section><title>Overview</title>

<p>Mapping tables allow operators to create read-only complex mapping tables with an ordered list of keys that match to an ordered list of values using the <uicontrol>Mapping Tables</uicontrol> menu option from the Common tab on the SM GUI. </p>
<p>A mapping provides a lookup that can have multiple input fields (keys) and multiple output fields. A mapping table defines the input key fields (what it is mapping from), and the output fields (what it is mapping to). The number of input and output fields, and their respective types, are assigned by the operator. The meaning of the keys and values are customer specific, and treated generically by the SPS. You define the meaning behind the fields through rules. Each call on the mapping tables performs one or more lookups in various tables.Â The values in one table, can be keys into another table, so tables can be inter-dependent (one-way).</p>
