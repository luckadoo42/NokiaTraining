<p>This chapter describes the parameters required to configure SM operators and their roles in the
            NCC.</p>
<p>The SM operator, along with an appropriate role and access details can be configured after
                                    selection from the hamburger menu ( <image
                                                href="../images/hamburgermenu_default.png"
                                                scale="40"/> ) in this tab. The SM operator option
                                    allows you to configure an SM operator, enter contact
                                    information, authentication, authorization, and language
                                    requirements, as well as assign roles to the operator. The
                                                <uicontrol>Roles</uicontrol> option allows you to
                                    create specific roles and to assign security domains to those
                                    roles for the operators.</p>
