                            <entry> Some attributes encode lists of multiple values. When multiple
                                values are recorded, each value starts on a new line. The policy
                                application uses the separators hash tag (":") by default. For
                                example, to log an attribute with the name policyCounters, which
                                could have a list of policy counters, the list returned would be :
                                separated. Each : means another entry. If each entry happens to be a
                                complex entry made up of a name (counter1) and value, the entry is
                                separated by another separator, the “#” by default—CDR Sub-Field

                                <p>The policy application does not allow service flow requests from
                                    both Rx and Gx. By default, this is set to false so that for one
                                    service flow, the policy application does not need to wait for
                                    the other side before responding to a message from a service
                                    flow.</p>
                                <p>For example, this application preference is used by the policy
                                    application when it receives requests for bearer creation. The
                                    requests can arrive on the Gx interface or the Rx interface and
                                    in some cases a bearer request can be received over both the Gx
                                    and the Rx interfaces. When a bearer request arrives over both
                                    interfaces, the policy application can impose a slight delay in
                                    processing either the Rx or the Gx while it waits for the
                                    accompanying request (which may never arrive) on the other
                                    interface. When set to false, the policy application processes
                                    incoming bearer requests without any delay.</p>

                                    destinationHost is needed in sending to the OCS. The outgoing
                                    messages towards the OCS includes the OCS Diameter identities
                                    that were learned from the initial establishment of the Sy

                                <p>It is possible for OCS to forward an SNR with different OCS
                                    identities, this too results in the Sy session getting updated
                                    with the new Diameter identities, which will be used in

                                    select the OCS and if those rules included the diameterHost.
                                    This indicates that the destinatioHost is included in the
                                    initial SLR. This is the only scenario that would include the
                                    host in the initial SLR. After that, the inclusion of the Host
                                    Identity is based on a application preference attribute and uses
                                    the identities that were learned from the far-end OCS.</p>

                                In this case, all IP numbers from 1.2.3.0 to 1.2.3.255 will match.
                                The bit width MUST be valid for the IP version and the IP number
                                MUST NOT have bits set beyond the mask. For a match to occur, the
                                same IP version must be present in the packet that was used in
                                describing the IP address. To test for a particular IP version, the
                                bits part can be set to zero. The keyword "any" is 0.0.0.0/0 or the
                                IPv6 equivalent. The keyword "assigned" is the address or set of
                                addresses assigned to the terminal. For IPv4, a typical first rule
                                is often "deny in ip! assigned". The sense of the match can be
                                inverted by preceding an address with the not modifier (!), causing
                                all other addresses to be matched instead. This does not affect the
                                selection of port numbers.</entry>

                            <entry colname="3"> Reauth Scheduler Buffer Size offers a means to
                                control outbound message loss by using a buffer to queue the related
                                reauthorization tasks. As the reauthorization tasks are about to
                                run, they enter into the buffer where they wait in a queue. The size
                                of that buffer can be configured here such that when the configured
                                value is reached, any new tasks that try to enter the buffer are
                                rejected. A lower outbound message rate will result as you lower the
                                value configured for this application preference. </entry>

                                    session. If only some of the flows have been terminated, the
                                    PCRF informs the AF about this via Rx:RAR. This is the default

                            <entry> Define whether system accepts SNR for failed sessions. If the
                                value of this system preference is <i>true</i>, then PCRF accepts
                                the SNR for failed session and <i>SLR-Intermediate</i> is triggered
                                towards OCS for retry of Sy Session. The <i>SLR-Intermediate</i>
                                which is triggered consists of counters combined from both the Sy
                                Session (For example counter = <varname>A</varname>) in DB and the
                                incoming SNR (For example counter = <varname>B</varname>).
                                    <i>SLR-Intermediate</i> counters = <varname>A,B</varname>. In
                                case there are no counters present in the DB, then <i>SLR
                                    intermediate</i> sends the request to all counters. If the
                                    <i>SLR-Intermediate</i> is rejected with 5002 error code, then
                                    <i>SLR-initial</i> is sent with the same content as
                                    <i>SLR-Intermediate</i> based on this system preference. When
                                accepting SNR for a failed Sy session, the RSV is not evaluated and
                                the counters are not processed. If the value of this system
                                preference is <i>false</i>, then the behavior is intact as previous
                                means it falls back to the existing behavior (SNR rejected with
                                    <varname>5002</varname> error code). </entry>

                                    min).User attaches at 01:58:10. Message comes too close to the
                                    start of interval. Rounding parameter value is added to user
                                    time to match with the intervals configured in Device. Now the
                                    user time is 02:00:10. Time 02.00.10 is matched with interval

                                <p>Provides a configurable duration of time in seconds before the
                                    record of a device with no sessions is deleted from an external
                                    SPR. </p>
                                <p>The Unused Device Expiry time is only applicable to Known LDAP
                                    devices. Unused device audits depend on successful known device
                                    audits as governed by the Device Data Expiry timer.</p>
                                <p>Known devices are audited, updated when they expire, and then
                                    checked for a session attachment. If the unused device expiry
                                    time is reached for the known device, the unused Device is
                                    marked for cleanup. If no session attachment occurs until the
                                    next audit run, the known unused device without a session is
                                    deleted at next audit time. </p>
                                <p>Nokia recommends to always have Unused Device Expiry Time
                                    (seconds) timer set equal to or less than the Device Data Expiry
                                    Time (seconds) so that it can take effect.</p>
                                <p>A minimum of 2 audit runs are required to remove the unused
                                    device after the timer expires for the known device. It is
                                    possible that more than two audit runs are necessary if there is
                                    a failover, where the newly active VM needs to execute another
                                    audit again to decide if the known device qualifies as unused or
                                    not.</p>
